# Intro to Fasteners

Welcome to the tools section of the construction documentation! For the first part of this section we will be taking a look at fasteners. Fasteners are essential for locking in paramount pieces that allow the robot to maintain form. Each type of fastener comes in many forms, shapes and sizes; while we may not cover every one of them in detail, we hope that this documentation gives you a strong foundation with using construction tools. 

### Screws
**Screws** are for **wood**. Screws are the basic fasteners used to **secure planks of wood** to **another piece of wood**. Some companies to sell sheet metal screws but our team prefers to use bolts as an alternative. Something **not to do** with a wood screw would be to **drive it into metal**. Another thing you **shouldn't do** with any screw is to **strip it**, which is essentially **nullifying the edges of the plus-sign** on the screw so much that your driver would be unable to get a grip to drive it in. Any stripped screws should be tossed in the trash to avoid miscommunications and incidents.

### Bolts
**Bolts** are like **screws**, but for **metal**. Although sheet metal screws are offered by various sellers, our team tends to use bolts. You can **identify** whether or not something is a **bolt or screw** based on whether or not it's **rounded** on the edge or **sharp** and pointy. Bolts are most often **accompanied by a fastener**, typically a lock nut, on the end to secure the bolt. The bolts that our team use are most likely a size **10-24** or **10-32** size, ranging from 0.25" to 3.00".

### Nuts
Using the right size wrench is the **MOST** important thing when it comes to tightening bolts because if you don't, then it will either be impossible or extremely difficult to do so. 

### Lock Nuts
Lock nuts are most often accompanied by bolts and are used to fasten bolts in place. One might attempt to fasten a lock nut by **holding** a **lock nut** in place with a **wrench of the correct size**, while using a **screwdriver** or **Allen** key to **bolt the bolt** into place. 

### Washer
Each screw or bolt has a **"head"**, which is that thicker part on the top of the screw or bolt. A **majority** of the times, **washers** **provide** the **spacing** that a spacer cannot do due to its thickness. The **other use** of a washer would be to **spread** the screw or bolt's head size by **using washers** slightly **larger** than the **head diameter**. Looking at this in another perspective, this might not be particularly useful in the event that one would not want to separation between the head and the desired platform.

### Spacers
There are **two types** of spacers: the **snap-on**, and the old-fashioned **slide-on**. Our team often uses snap-on **hex** spacers that are 3D-printed. The sizes that our spacers come in normally range between 0.125" and 1.00" in length. The **difference** betweenn a **spacer** and a **washer** is that screws and bolts can **go through** the washer to **provide spacing**, whereas **spacers** are just **space providers**. It is **not possible** to **thread** a screw or bolt through one of our **snap-on hex spacers** because that hexagonal part of the spacer **snaps** onto an **axle**. One may use a spacer in order to **provide** **spacing** **between wheels or rollers**. The **advantage** of using a snap-on spacer is that it literally **just snaps on**. No taking out anything on either side of the axle to slide in the spacer. But this means that a **snap-on spacer** is more **likely** to **fall** off after **enduring a hard impact**. 

### Rivets
**Rivets** are sort of like **staples**, except they go through **holes**, like a **bolt**. Think of a rivet as if it was a bolt being attached using a staple gun. Rivets are attached using **rivet guns**. Something to take note however, is that a rivet must be the **semi-correct size** in order for the rivet to actually stay into the desired platform, **typically** sheet metal or **drivetrain tubing**. 

### Staples
Sort of self-explanatory. Staples are used for stapling things to each other. FRC High School teams typically use staples for putting together **bumpers** (see **Robot Mechanisms & Parts of a Robot** page).
