### CPR

“For healthcare providers and those trained: conventional CPR using chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth breathing at a ratio of 30:2 compressions-to-breaths. In adult victims of cardiac arrest, it is reasonable for rescuers to perform chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120/min and to a depth of at least 2 inches (5 cm) for an average adult, while avoiding excessive chest compression depths (greater than 2.4 inches [6 cm]).”

“For the general public or bystanders who witness an adult suddenly collapse: compression-only CPR, or Hands-Only CPR. Hands-Only CPR is CPR without mouth-to-mouth breaths. It is recommended for use by people who see a teen or adult suddenly collapse in an out-of-hospital setting (such as at home, at work, or in a park).”

2 steps to Hands-Only CPR:  
&ensp;1. Call 9-1-1 (or send someone to do that)  
&ensp;2. Push hard and fast in the center of the chest  

### Remember:
1. Minimize interruptions in chest compressions  
2. Provide compressions of adequate rate and depth  
3. Avoid leaning on the victim between compressions  
4. Ensure proper hand placement  
5. Avoid excessive ventilation
